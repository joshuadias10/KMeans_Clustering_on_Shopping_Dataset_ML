# K-Means Clustering on Shopping Data

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that applies K-Means clustering to a shopping dataset to identify and analyze distinct customer segments. The script uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and provides visualizations to help interpret the results.

## Features

- **K-Means Clustering**: Segments customers based on their annual income and spending score.
- **Elbow Method**: Identifies the optimal number of clusters for the K-Means algorithm.
- **Visualizations**: Includes plots for the Elbow Method and scatter plots of clustered data.

## Files

- `KMeans_Clustering_on_Shopping_Dataset.ipynb`: Python script for clustering, including Elbow Method implementation and result visualizations.

## Installation

To run the script, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
